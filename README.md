# Fetal Health Classification Hackathon

## Authors

Rachael Friedman, Julia Rowe, Afsara Ali, Katie Sylvia

## Summary

Our group built a model to predict fetal health classification (normal, suspect, or pathological) with 95% accuracy on testing data. We used a Gradient Boost Classification model as our final model after testing many different classifciation models. This model was deployed to a Streamlit app that health professionals could use wtih CTG information from their pateints.  

## Dataset

The fetal health CTG data comes from Kaggle.
